There's a bunch of cruft in here. Nowadays I'm using `xonsh`, not bash, and I'm trying to migrate from vim to neovim. The install scripts pretty much don't work and should be avoided, but there's some important system-level configuration in there that I have to run once on a new system. In other words: don't clone this repo, but feel free to crib from it.

For `direnv` users:

If you have cloned this repository, you will want to be sure to edit the `/.envrc` file. I use this to coerce git into using my personal identity so I can stop pushing commits with my work email and whatnot.
