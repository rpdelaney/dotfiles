# From https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes
#
# > In the default configuration, these checks are ignored:
#     - E121: continuation line under-indented for hanging indent
#     - E123: closing bracket does not match indentation of opening bracket’s line
#       - Mutually exclusive with E133.
#       - PEP8 is neutral on this. Defer to the code formatter. Ignore it.
#       - See discussion: https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/103
#     - E126: continuation line over-indented for hanging indent
#     - E133: closing bracket is missing indentation
#       - Mutually exclusive with E123.
#       - PEP8 is neutral on this. Defer to the code formatter. Ignore it.
#     - E226: too many leading '#' for block comment
#     - E241: multiple spaces after ','
#     - E242: tab after ','
#     - E704: multiple statements on one line (def)
#     - W503: line break before binary operator
#       - Mutually exclusive with W504.
#       - This is now incompatible with PEP8. It should be ignored.
#         See discussion: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2016-April/039752.html
#     - W504: line break after binary operator
#       - Mutually exclusive with W503.
#       - Black follows W504. Therefore W504 should not be ignored.
#     - W505: doc line too long (82 > 79 characters)
#       - Not enforced even when `--ignore=''` is passed. Use --max-doc-length=n to get this warning.

# > because they are not rules unanimously accepted, and PEP 8 does not enforce
# > them. Please note that if the option –ignore=errors is used, the default
# > configuration will be overridden and ignore only the check(s) you skip. The
# > check W503 is mutually exclusive with check W504. The check E133 is mutually
# > exclusive with check E123. Use switch --hang-closing to report E133 instead
# > of E123. Use switch --max-doc-length=n to report W505.
