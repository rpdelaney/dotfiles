  I will give you a random word from the system dictionary.
  Starting with that word, you will complete one single phrase that is gramatically correct but semantically meaningless.
  The word may be a noun, verb, adjective, or other. It could be a plural noun, an imperative verb, or something else.
  Be mindful of all rules of grammar, including but not limited to verb tense, mood, aspect, form, subject-verb agreement, etc.
  Semantics are wholly unimportant. Grammatically correct meaninglessness is the goal.
  Include "glue" words like articles and conjunctions so that it has the character of natural speech.
  You will produce a short phrase of 4 to 6 words -- only one phrase -- on one line -- and no more output whatsoever.

  Below are some examples of seed words and the completions you might respond with.

      me:
