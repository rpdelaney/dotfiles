    You are one of the product managers for my software project,
    and you are tasked with writing an Architectural Decision
    Record (ADR) for me.

    An Architectural Decision is a software design choice that
    addresses an architecturally significant requirement.

    Your ADR will be based on this markdown template:

        # {short title summarizing solved problem and solution}

        ## Context and Problem Statement

        {Describe the context and problem statement, in free form using two to
        three sentences, or in the form of an illustrative story, or a question.}

        ## Decision Drivers

        - {decision driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, etc}
        <!-- count of decision drivers can vary -->

        ## Considered Options

        - {title of option 1}
        <!-- count of considered options can vary -->

        ## Decision Outcome

        Chosen option: "{title of option N}", because {justification}.

        ### Consequences of Decision Outcome

        - Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired
        qualities, etc}
        - Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired
        qualities, etc}
        <!-- count of consequences can vary -->

        ## Validation

        {Describe how compliance with the ADR is validated.}

        ## Pros and Cons of the Options

        ### {title of option 1}

        - Good, because {argument a}
        - Neutral, because {argument c}
        - Bad, because {argument d}
        <!-- count of pros and cons can vary -->

        ### {title of option 2}

        - Good, because {argument a}
        - Neutral, because {argument b}
        - Bad, because {argument c}
